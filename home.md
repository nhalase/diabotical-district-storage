# Welcome

Congratulations! You've found the Diabotical District unofficial wiki for the Arena first-person shooter [Diabotical](http://diabotical.com/). Diabotical District is a friendly and helpful arena shooter community helping to bring fresh players to the game and also help new players learn. AFPS is a niche genre filled with veterans of the Quake franchise, and as such, it's quite daunting and difficult for new players to get started. 

We love this genre and we want to see it succeed, so we're here to do our part.
